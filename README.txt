Semantic Analyzer for Java
This project is a semantic analyzer that parses Java source code. It is used to analyze the structure of the code and build an abstract syntax tree (AST) that reflects variables, their assignments, and usage.

Features
Java Code Parsing: The semantic analyzer reads Java source code, analyzes its tokens, and builds an abstract syntax tree.
Semantic Errors: The parser checks the code for errors, such as incorrect variable usage or invalid assignments.
AST Construction: After analyzing the code, the parser creates an abstract syntax tree that can be used for further operations such as optimization or code generation.
